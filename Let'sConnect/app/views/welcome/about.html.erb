Recent advances in the Web have rapidly changed our life in various ways. These advances provide new ways for people to communicate and assess vast amounts of information. The Web provides educators with opportunities to implement a range of new teaching and learning practices, which redefine learning experiences. The Web enables a so-called WBI (Web-Based Instruction) system as a teaching aid. The WBI system, which integrates a hypertext information network with communication and collaborative tools, presents two important innovative features: first, it provides specific tools to manipulate the multimedia information contents of the Web pages; second, authorized users can modify the information network in the system.</p>
